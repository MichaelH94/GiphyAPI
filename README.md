This is an assignment for the KU coding bootcamp.

This is a simple Giphy API Search app. It was built with HTML, CSS (BootStrap) and JavaScript (jQuery). The default topics to choose from are from the Super Smash Bros. series. Users can also add their own search topic using the form on the page. 

Most of the code is stored in a single object for easy accessibility. Topics are stored in an array and printed in the form of buttons using a for loop and jQuery. Results are pulled from the Giphy API using ajax, and then printed on the page with a for loop using jQuery.
